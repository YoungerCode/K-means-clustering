## Clustering whisky distilleries according to tasting Profiles

Clustering whisky distilleries by their tasting profile using the elbow method for nuber of clusters 

In this project we used K-means clustering to cluster whisky distilleries by their tasting profile.
We opted  for elbow method to find the optimal number of clusters.
To find the success of this clustering relavant metrics(e.g  silhouette, adjusted rand index, etc.) are to be reported

To conclude, the main diffences( factors that differ between classes) between the clusters are observed ...
